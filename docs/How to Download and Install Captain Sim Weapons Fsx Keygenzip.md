Once you have downloaded the file, you need to extract it using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You should get a folder named "Captain\_Sim\_Weapons\_Fsx\_Keygen" that contains several files and subfolders.
 
## Step 2: Install Captain Sim Weapons Fsx Keygen.zip

Here are the files and folders you need to copy and paste:
